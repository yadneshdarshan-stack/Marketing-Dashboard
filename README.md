5) Knowledge and Wisdom
Technical Knowledge Gained
DAX Proficiency: Creating complex measures for aggregations, calculating engagement rates, and building dynamic totals that respond to filter context
Data Visualization Best Practices: Selecting appropriate chart types (bar for comparisons, pie for composition, donut for part-to-whole relationships) based on analytical needs​
Dashboard Design: Implementing color-coding schemes and layout strategies for effective information hierarchy and user experience

Business Insights & Wisdom
Market Concentration: India dominates with 3.5M engagements, representing a critical market that requires sustained investment focus​
Geographic Diversification: While India leads, secondary markets (UK, Singapore, Australia) show significant engagement potential that shouldn't be overlooked​
Rural Market Opportunity: The 89% rural penetration in India reveals untapped potential in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, suggesting opportunities for targeted rural marketing campaigns​
Campaign Consistency: Relatively stable monthly click patterns (5-7M range) indicate consistent brand engagement, though identifying peak months can optimize campaign timing​

Strategic Wisdom: Data-driven marketing requires balancing investment between high-performing markets and emerging opportunities while understanding demographic nuances like urban-rural divides
